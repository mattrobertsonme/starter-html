# Starter HTML

Starter HTML made for Bootstrap 3.0

## Getting Started

1. Download or copy the latest version, the starter HTML has everything you'll need
2. Get the latest version of the starter SASS and add it to the sass folder
3. Add new files to the structure as needed so for example to add a new video custom post type, copy `single-post.html` and rename it `single-video.html`
4. Modify the navigation as necessary if adding extra files, using a text editor the easiest way is to do a find and replace 
5. Replace the text inside change to `[Theme Name]` with `Magazine`. Change `#[themename]-plus-header-nav` with `#[sharp]-plus-header-nav`
